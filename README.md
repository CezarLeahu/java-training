# Presenter
I'm a Software Engineer with some 12 years of experience with Java and Spring, among other things.
I've formed some strong opinions about Enterprise software development during this time, I've seen a couple of horror stories and projects, seen a few good ones too. I'm always happy to rant about all of them.

# What you will learn
  We'll go over the Java basics, both the core technology and the language syntax. We'll won't go much into details, and instead we'll focus on things that often get overlooked or forgotten when programming in Java.
  The main topics we'll discuss are Collections, Exceptions, Generics, AOP, Multithreading and Functional programming in Java. We'll cover some of the good and bad practices around those topics.
  
# Prerequisites
Participants should be familiar with at least one OOP language (C++, C#, Python, TypeScript). We'll skim over the Java particularities, but the common OOP fundamentals should already be understood.
